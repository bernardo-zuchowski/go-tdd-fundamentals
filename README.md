# Go TDD Fundamentals

[Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

- [x] Hello, World
  - Declaring functions, with arguments and return types
  - `if`, `const` and `switch`
  - Declaring variables and constants 
- [x] Integers
  - Integers, addition
  - Writing better documentation so users of our code can understand its usage quickly
  - Examples of how to use our code, which are checked as part of our tests 
- [x] Iteration
  - More TDD practice
  - Learned `for`
  - Learned how to write benchmarks
- [x] Arrays and slices
  - Arrays
  - Slices
  - The various ways to `make` them
  - How they have a fixed capacity but you can create new slices from old ones using `append`
  - How to slice, slices!
  - `len` to get the length of an array or slice
  - Test coverage tool
  - `reflect.DeepEqual` and why it's useful but can reduce the type-safety of your code
- [x] Structs, methods & interfaces
  - Declaring structs to create your own data types which lets you bundle related data together and make the intent of your code clearer
  - Declaring interfaces so you can define functions that can be used by different types (parametric polymorphism)
  - Adding methods so you can add functionality to your data types and so you can implement interfaces
  - Table driven tests to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain
