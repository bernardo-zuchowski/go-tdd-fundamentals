# Go TDD Fundamentals

- [x] Hello, World
  - Declaring functions, with arguments and return types
  - `if`, `const` and `switch`
  - Declaring variables and constants 
- [x] Integers
  - Integers, addition
  - Writing better documentation so users of our code can understand its usage quickly
  - Examples of how to use our code, which are checked as part of our tests 
- [x] Iteration
  - More TDD practice
  - Learned `for`
  - Learned how to write benchmarks
- [x] Arrays and slices
  - Arrays
  - Slices
  - The various ways to `make` them
  - How they have a fixed capacity but you can create new slices from old ones using `append`
  - How to slice, slices!
  - `len` to get the length of an array or slice
  - Test coverage tool
  - `reflect.DeepEqual` and why it's useful but can reduce the type-safety of your code
- [x] Structs, methods & interfaces
  - Declaring structs to create your own data types which lets you bundle related data together and make the intent of your code clearer
  - Declaring interfaces so you can define functions that can be used by different types (parametric polymorphism)
  - Adding methods so you can add functionality to your data types and so you can implement interfaces
  - Table driven tests to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain
- [x] Pointers & errors
  - Pointers
    - Go copies values when you pass them to functions/methods, so if you're writing a function that needs to mutate state you'll need it to take a pointer to the thing you want to change.
    - The fact that Go takes a copy of values is useful a lot of the time but sometimes you won't want your system to make a copy of something, in which case you need to pass a reference. Examples include referencing very large data structures or things where only one instance is necessary (like database connection pools).
  - nil
    - Pointers can be nil
    - When a function returns a pointer to something, you need to make sure you check if it's nil or you might raise a runtime exception - the compiler won't help you here.
    - Useful for when you want to describe a value that could be missing
  - Errors
    - Errors are the way to signify failure when calling a function/method.
    - By listening to our tests we concluded that checking for a string in an error would result in a flaky test. So we refactored our implementation to use a meaningful value instead and this resulted in easier to test code and concluded this would be easier for users of our API too.
    - This is not the end of the story with error handling, you can do more sophisticated things but this is just an intro. Later sections will cover more strategies.

  - Create new types from existing ones
    - Useful for adding more domain specific meaning to values
    - Can let you implement interfaces
